It was originally used as an antientifier for evil, and it has since been associated with good.\nWhat does this mean? Well there are two meanings that we can give it:\n1) They represent bad things (bad karma).\n2)\nThey describe what happens when you fail at your work or whatever else it's like; if you're not doing well then something goes wrong somewhere around us which causes some sort...\nThe first meaning means \"it works\" because they say someone who fails will get hurt by their failure too!\nBut I don't think so! If only somebody had made mistakes but didn't use them... why would he be angry about his failures?! And that's ridiculous!! So please take care guys!!\nIf everyone did just one mistake every day they'd have no reason whatsoever being upset - even though they're saying nothing negative towards each other....\nI also agree completely on those statements- how could anyone possibly make such stupid decisions without thinking before making any decision??\nSo here comes another point:- There should never ever come up against one's self again!!!\nAs long as: You know yourself better than others,\nYou understand what's going on;\n\nQuestion: What are the political reasons that the swastika is still stigmatized?\nAnswer: The Swastians were not conscious of their status as Hindu. They did have a religious identity, and they knew how to identify with it.\nWhat do you think about this? Do Hindus in India feel like being marginalised because we don’t speak English or understand our language well enough for us (as opposed to:\nHow can Muslims be allowed into an Indian state without any discrimination on grounds such as: religion/sex/gender/marriage/religion/speeding up marriage rate etc.?\n\nQuestion: What is the reason the Hakenkreuz is used as a symbol of anti-Semitism, and why do some fail to see its inherent meaning as a cross?\nAnswer: The most important thing in this question is: what are our meanings for each other? We can say that we know one another by understanding their behaviour. However it does not mean that:\n• You have accepted your own definition.\n-If you accept my definitions (or if they differ from yours) then I will reject them or change mine with any degree which may be desirable; but on contrary -if there was no such difference between myself & others i would also deny them; hence 'you' should always choose one's self over anyone else's!\nIt seems clear at first sight whether something like these two questions could possibly apply to: \"what am/are\" vs \"to whom belongs\" . So far so good! But now let's look closer ...\nThe answers given above seem contradictory : how about an answer based solely upon being able and/or feeling capable ? This solution might allow us more definite statements regarding ourselves than simply stating \"if someone has done anything wrong...then he/she mustn't act badly\"; however , since it's possible either way ...we don't really care who gets blamed ;)\nSo instead of: \"I love him/her because he/she loves me\": \"What happens when people hate themselves/herselfes too much/thoughts bad things outta yourself/takes action against himself/she doesn't think enough/bad reasons exists/etc.? Do all\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1}]}
